Caltech CS 155 Winter 2018

Code for projects in [Caltech's CS155: Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://www.yisongyue.com/courses/cs155/2018_winter/), developed by team [Aw Young Qingzhuo](https://github.com/veniversum), [Ola Kalisz](https://github.com/pistacja96), and [Riley Patterson](https://github.com/rylz).

### Miniproject 1: Amazon Review Sentiment Detection

The first project is a Kaggle competition to detect sentiment in Amazon reviews. Details on the task are provided on the [Kaggle project page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/caltech-cs-155-2018), and our code is in the [src directory](src), in particular in [a jupyter notebook](src/generate_first_layer.ipynb) for training individual models and in [this source file defining a stacked neural net using these results](stacked_neural_net_model.py).

Initial summaries of results for individual models were tracked in [this issue](issues/1), and further results will be in project report.
